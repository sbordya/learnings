# Data Types and Variables

Write a smart contract named `DataTypes` that declares four `public` state variables as follows:

- A variable named `smallNumber` that can store numbers in the range of `0 - 255` that is equal to `9`.
- A variable named `negativeNumber` that can store numbers in the range of `-127 - 128` that is equal to `-7`.
- A variable named `zeroAddress` that stores an address and is equal to the zero address.
- A variable named `canEdit` that stores a boolean and is equal to `true`.

Use the most correct data type for each variable. The order in which you declare them does not matter.

Note: For our automated tests to run properly you'll need to make sure you denote your state/storage variables as `public`. For example, if you were defining a variable named `x` you'd do it like so `uint public x;`.
