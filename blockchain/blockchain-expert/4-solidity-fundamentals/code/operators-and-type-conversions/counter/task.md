# Counter

Complete the `Timer` smart contract such that each function implements the functionality described below. All these functions should use the `count` state variable. The `count` variable represents the number of seconds on the timer that have elapsed.

- `increment`: should increase the count by one.
- `decrement`: should decrease the count by one.
- `reset`: should reset the count to zero.
- `addBy`: should add the passed value to the count.
- `subtractBy`: should subtract the passed value to the count.
- `multiplyBy`: should multiply the count by the the passed value.
- `getMinutesElapsed`: should return the number of minutes based on the current count (there are 60 seconds in 1 minute).
