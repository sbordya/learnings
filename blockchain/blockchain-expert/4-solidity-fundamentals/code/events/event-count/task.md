# Event Count

Write a smart contract named `EventEmitter` that contains a single public function called `count`. This function should emit an event named `Called` that contains two parameters:

- `count`: the number of times this event has been emitted, this value should start at `1`.
- `sender`: the address of the account that called this function.

You may add as many state variables as necessary but do **not** add any functions.
