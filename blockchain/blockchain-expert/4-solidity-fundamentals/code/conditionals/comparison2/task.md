# Comparison 2

Within the `Comparison` smart contract complete the `compare` function that accepts two `int` arguments. This function should return the following `int` values:

- `0`: if the arguments are the same value.
- `1`: if the first argument is greater than the second.
- `-1`: if the second argument is greater than the first.

Please use the conditional operator `?` to complete this problem. Do not use `if/else/else if` statements. You may need to use multiple conditional operators.
