# Module Summary: Blockchain and Web3

## 1. Introduction to Blockchain and Web3

- **Blockchain**: A decentralized, immutable digital ledger storing transactions across a network of computers.
- **Web 1.0**: The "read-only" internet — static pages, minimal interaction, information delivery focus.
- **Web 2.0**: The "read-write" internet — social media, dynamic content, rich user interfaces, but centralized data control by companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon.
- **Web 3.0**: The "read-write-own" internet — decentralized applications, blockchain integration, token economies, user control over data.

## 2. Centralized vs Decentralized

- **Centralized systems**: Single authority manages and stores data; faster decision-making but vulnerable to censorship and single points of failure.
- **Decentralized systems**: Multiple nodes share control; improves resilience, transparency, and trust, but may have slower consensus.

## 3. Ledgers

- A **ledger** is a record-keeping system for transactions.
- In blockchain, ledgers are distributed, cryptographically secured, and updated via consensus protocols.

## 4. Wallets

- Digital wallets store public and private keys.
- **Hot wallets**: Connected to the internet, convenient but less secure.
- **Cold wallets**: Offline storage, more secure against hacks.

## 5. Transactions

- Transfer of value recorded on the blockchain.
- Must be verified by network nodes before being added to the ledger.
- Includes sender/receiver addresses, amount, and digital signatures.

## 6. Blocks

- A block contains:
  - A list of validated transactions
  - Timestamp
  - Hash of the previous block
- Linking blocks forms the blockchain, ensuring immutability.

## 7. Blockchain Security

- Relies on **cryptography**, **consensus mechanisms**, and **decentralization**.
- Resistant to data tampering because altering one block would require changing all subsequent blocks.

## 8. Proof of Work (PoW)

- Miners solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and add new blocks.
- Energy-intensive but highly secure.

## 9. Proof of Stake (PoS)

- Validators are chosen based on cryptocurrency holdings (“stake”).
- Energy-efficient alternative to PoW.
- Penalizes malicious validators by taking their stake.

## 10. Nodes and Masternodes

- **Node**: Any computer connected to the blockchain network that stores a copy of the ledger.
- **Masternode**: Special node offering extra functions (instant transactions, governance voting) in return for a larger stake.

## 11. Bitcoin Summary

- First decentralized cryptocurrency, launched in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto.
- Uses PoW consensus, limited supply of 21 million coins.
- Inspired thousands of alternative blockchain projects.
