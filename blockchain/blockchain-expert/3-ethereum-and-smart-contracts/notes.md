# Module Summary: Cryptocurrency and Ethereum

## 1. Introduction to Cryptocurrency

- **Cryptocurrency**: A form of decentralized digital currency, not issued by a central authority.
- Transactions are recorded on a blockchain and verified by a distributed network of nodes.
- **Fiat Currency**: Government-issued money not backed by a commodity (e.g., USD, EUR, CAD).
- **Whitepaper**: A document explaining the technology, purpose, tokenomics, and roadmap of a project.

## 2. Ethereum Basics

- Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain platform enabling smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps).
- Uses its own cryptocurrency, **Ether (ETH)**, to pay transaction fees ("gas").
- Supports a programmable environment via the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
- Launched in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin and others.

## 3. Smart Contracts and DApps

- **Smart Contracts**: Self-executing code stored on the blockchain that runs when predefined conditions are met.
- **DApps**: Decentralized applications that use smart contracts for backend logic while often having a familiar web/mobile interface.
- Benefits: transparency, immutability, censorship resistance.

## 4. ERC-20 Tokens

- Technical standard for fungible tokens on Ethereum.
- Defines functions like `transfer`, `approve`, `balanceOf`.
- Widely used for cryptocurrencies, governance tokens, and utility tokens.

## 5. ERC-721 Tokens (NFTs)

- Technical standard for non-fungible tokens.
- Each token is unique and indivisible.
- Used for digital art, collectibles, gaming assets, and proof of ownership.

## 6. Blockchain Comparisons

- **Bitcoin vs Ethereum**: Bitcoin focuses on peer-to-peer payments; Ethereum focuses on programmable contracts and applications.
- Other blockchains (e.g., Solana, Polkadot) differ in consensus, scalability, and interoperability.

## 7. Stablecoins

- Cryptocurrencies pegged to a stable asset (e.g., USD) to reduce volatility.
- **Types**:
  - Fiat-backed (e.g., USDC, USDT)
  - Crypto-backed (e.g., DAI)
  - Algorithmic (maintain peg via supply adjustments)

## 8. Introduction to Oracles

- Oracles connect blockchains with external data sources.
- Allow smart contracts to react to real-world events (e.g., price feeds, weather data).
- Can be centralized or decentralized (e.g., Chainlink).
