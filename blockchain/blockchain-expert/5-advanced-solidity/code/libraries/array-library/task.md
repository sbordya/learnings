# Array Library

Write a library named `Array` that provides some helpful array functions as defined below.

- `indexOf(int[] numbers, int target)`: a function that returns an `int` representing the index of the first occurrence of the passed `target` in the `numbers` array. This function should return `-1` if the `target` does not exist in the `numbers` array.
- `count(int[] numbers, int target)`: a function that returns the count/frequency of the passed `target` in the `numbers` array. This function should return the count as a `uint`.
- `sum(int[] numbers)`: a function that returns the sum of the values in the `numbers` array. If the array is empty this function should return `0`.

All of the above functions should be marked as public.
