# Score Tracker ðŸŸ¢

For this question you'll be asked to write a set of contracts that will allow you to track the winning teams across multiple types of games.

Start by writing an `abstract` contract named `Game` that will implement the base functionality for all games. This contract should be initialized by passing the `string homeTeam` and the `string awayTeam`. It should also include the following functions.

- `getHomeTeamScore()`: an abstract internal function that returns the `uint` score of the home team. This function should be overridden by any child contracts.

- `getAwayTeamScore()`: an abstract internal function that returns the `uint` score of the away team. This function should be overridden by any child contracts.

- `getWinningTeam()`: a public concrete function that returns the `string` name of the winning team for this game.

After completing this contract write the following two children contracts named `BasketballGame` and `SoccerGame` that inherit from `Game`.

The `BasketballGame` contract should override the necessary functions from `Game` and implement the following additional functions.

- `homeTeamScored(uint score)`: this external function should increment the home teams score by the passed `score`. The only valid scores are `1`, `2` and `3`, the function should fail if you pass an invalid score.

- `awayTeamScored(uint score)`: this external function should increment the away teams score by the passed `score`. The only valid scores are `1`, `2` and `3`, the function should fail if you pass an invalid score.

The `SoccerGame` contract should override the necessary functions from `Game` and implement the following additional functions.

- `homeTeamScored()`: this external function should increment the home teams score by one.

- `awayTeamScored()`: this external function should increment the away teams score by one.

Make sure to use the correct function signatures, contract names, visibility modifiers and parameter/return value types.
