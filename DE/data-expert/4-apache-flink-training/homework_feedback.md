**Feedback for Flink Job and SQL Script Submission**

### **Flink Job Review:**

1. **Correctness:**

   - The Flink job appears to sessionize the events based on IP address and host using a session window with a 5-minute gap, which meets the requirements.
   - The job writes the aggregated results to a PostgreSQL table, correctly using the JDBC connector.

2. **Code Quality:**

   - The script is generally well-structured and readable, but a few improvements could be made:
     - Consider using more descriptive variable and function names for better clarity (e.g., naming `log_aggregation` as `run_sessionization_job`).
     - Ensure consistent formatting and import ordering to enhance readability.

3. **Testing Instructions:**

   - The README provides clear guidelines for setting up the environment and executing the Flink job.
   - It is suggested to include a small description within the README about how to verify running sessions or check for expected outcomes post-execution.

4. **Documentation:**
   - The README file provides concise instructions on running the Flink job and setting up dependencies.
   - While the README mentions sample outputs from the PostgreSQL table, it could benefit from explaining how the sample relates to verifying the sessionization job.

### **SQL Script Review:**

1. **Correctness:**

   - The SQL script correctly calculates the average number of web events per session, both for Tech Creator and across different hosts.
   - Proper `group by` and `ordering` are used to derive comparative insights among the specified hosts.

2. **Code Quality:**

   - The SQL queries are neatly formatted and make proper use of SQL functions and clauses to achieve the desired results.
   - The script might be enhanced by providing comments explaining the calculation logic for those less familiar with SQL.

3. **Documentation:**
   - The homework.sql file includes expected results, which helps in verifying correctness.

### **General Observations:**

- Ensure environmental variables (like KAFKA_URL, KAFKA_TOPIC) are accurately configured and documented, as they are critical for the script execution.
- Sample data or results (as included in README) should ideally demonstrate the correctness of sessionization logic via comprehensive examples.

### **Areas for Improvement:**

- Introduce handling for exceptions or logging within the Flink job for better monitoring and debugging.
- Check your Docker compose instructions for accuracy to minimize issues when setting up and executing the job.

### **Overall Evaluation:**

Your submission effectively meets the core requirements of the homework in both code and SQL analytics. Minor improvements in readability and error handling will further strengthen your solution.

### **Final Grade:**
