** This feedback is auto-generated from an LLM **

Hello,

Thank you for your submission. After reviewing your implementation, I have the following feedback:

1. **De-duplication Query**:

   - The query uses `SELECT DISTINCT * FROM game_details;` which is a straightforward way to remove duplicates, but it may not be the most efficient approach as it selects all columns without specifying the ones leading to duplicates. A more optimal approach would involve specifying the key columns directly to ensure clarity and efficiency, for example: `SELECT * FROM (SELECT DISTINCT ON (game_id, team_id, player_id) * FROM game_details) AS distinct_game_details;`.

2. **User Devices Activity Datelist DDL**:

   - The DDL for `user_devices_cumulated` is well structured with correct handling of the `device_activity_datelist` as an array of dates. The use of a composite primary key is appropriate for maintaining unique records.

3. **User Devices Activity Datelist Implementation**:

   - The implementation is quite comprehensive, employing a PL/pgSQL procedure to accumulate data. This correctly joins `events` and `devices` tables and utilizes a full outer join with the previous day's data.
   - The approach for appending dates to `device_activity_datelist` is sound; however, in a real scenario, consider using a more performant method for dealing with large datasets.

4. **User Devices Activity Int Datelist**:

   - The transformation of `device_activity_datelist` into a base-2 integer is handled correctly. The `UNNEST` and `POW` functions have been utilized appropriately, and the overall logic is accurate.
   - Consider adding comments explaining the choice of `31` as the power base adjustment (assuming a month's reach).

5. **Host Activity Datelist DDL**:
   - The `hosts_cumulated` table definition is straightforward and meets requirements. The inclusion of a `primary key` on `host` and `curr_date` is correct.
6. **Host Activity Datelist Implementation**:

   - Like the user devices activity implementation, this part effectively manages the incremental updates and full outer joins to gather daily activity data. The logic for appending to `host_activity_datelist` is appropriately applied.

7. **Reduced Host Fact Array DDL**:

   - The schema for `host_activity_reduced` is well defined.
   - The choice to use arrays for `hit_list` and `unique_visitors_list` matches the prompt's requirements.

8. **Reduced Host Fact Array Implementation**:
   - The daily update logic is appropriate, and the use of `COALESCE` to handle existing arrays or fill with zeros is a good approach.
   - The use of `ON CONFLICT` for conflict resolution ensures data integrity and updates records as expected.

Overall, your submission demonstrates a strong understanding of fact data modeling and SQL best practices. Your solutions are thoughtful and correctly address the required implementations. A minor point of improvement would be to provide additional comments for clarity, especially in complex queries for future maintainability.
