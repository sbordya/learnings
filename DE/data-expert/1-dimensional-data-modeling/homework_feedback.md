** This feedback is auto-generated from an LLM **

Thank you for your submission. Here is my detailed feedback on your SQL script:

**1. Setup and Data Types:**

- You correctly drop existing tables and types before creating new ones to ensure a clean setup.
- You’ve defined the `quality_class` as an ENUM with appropriate values ('star', 'good', 'average', 'bad'), which is beneficial for maintaining data integrity.
- The composite type `films` accurately reflects the data structure for each film, and you've correctly utilized a dynamic array of this type in the `actors` table.

**2. Actors Table:**

- The `actors` table is well-structured, utilizing a composite type for films and setting primary keys correctly with `actorid` and `year`.
- Using a boolean for `is_active` is efficient for tracking an actor’s active status per year.

**3. Data Processing Loop:**

- The loop setup rightly processes from `min_year` to `max_year`, effectively populating data for each actor's yearly record.
- In the `increment` CTE, you correctly use a FULL OUTER JOIN to combine `current_year` and `previous_year`, ensuring that data from both sources is included.

**4. Actors History SCD Table:**

- The creation of the `actors_history_scd` table is properly executed, using appropriate PRIMARY KEY constraints.
- Your approach to tracking changes in `actors` using windows functions like `lag` and `sum` is efficient.
- The use of CTEs to isolate stages of data processing is neat and benefits readability.
- The use of `on conflict` in the final insert statement for `actors_history_scd` effectively ensures that duplicate entries are avoided, updating the `end_date` where necessary.

**5. Error Handling:**

- Ensure comprehensive error handling in any `DO $$ BEGIN END $$` blocks. Currently, the script assumes perfect conditions.

**Improvements:**

- While your code is generally well-executed, adding comments within the SQL script would improve readability and maintainability. This is critical for understanding each step of your CTEs and their purpose.
- Consider handling exceptions within the PL/pgSQL block to anticipate and manage potential runtime errors.

**Overall Comments:**

- This is a well-structured submission with clean SQL practices. You've clearly driven the table setups and historical data management through effective use of SQL features. Some minor improvements can be made by adding comments for better code comprehension and maintainability.

Given the quality and correctness of your submission, your work meets the expectations outlined in the rubric. Well done!
