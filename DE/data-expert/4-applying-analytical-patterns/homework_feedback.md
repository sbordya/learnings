Thank you for submitting your homework! Here's a detailed review of your SQL queries and overall submission:

### Query 1: State Change Tracking for Players

- **Correctness:** The logic for determining the players' states based on their `is_active` status looks accurate.
- **Efficiency and Clarity:** The use of `lag()` and `case` statement is well-executed.
- **Improvement:** Ensure that your logic accommodates edge cases such as the first ever record for a player; your query currently assumes the first `prev_is_active` status to be `null`.

### Query 2: Aggregations with GROUPING SETS

- **Correctness:** The transformations and combination via `GROUPING SETS` to produce aggregated insights along various dimensions are well done.
- **Efficiency and Computation:** The restructuring to capture winning matches using logic with the `unnest` function is an effective choice.
- **Improvement:** Consider adding explicit column names in the final selection for clarity.

### Query 3: Most Points for a Single Team

- **Correctness:** The logic accurately filters and finds the player with the most points for a single team.
- **Improvement:** The comment suggests a specific player and points, but it's helpful to match any changes within the actual query logic.

### Query 4: Most Points in a Single Season

- **Correctness:** Correctly identifies the player with the most points in a single season.
- **Comment:** Same note as above regarding aligning comments with query results.

### Query 5: Team with Most Wins

- **Correctness:** Successfully identifies the team with the most total wins. Your use of filtering on `curr_player` and `team_abbreviation` with `season` worked well.
- **Comment:** Align the inline comment with the output for consistency.

### Query 6: 90-Game Stretch Wins Using Window Functions

- **Correctness:** This effectively uses window functions to calculate the most wins in rolling 90-game windows.
- **Optimization:** Well done with the `rows between 90 preceding and current row` statement to capture the stretch.
- **Improvement:** Ensure that the logic accounts for varying row counts at the start of the observation window.

### Query 7: Longest Streak Over 10 Points for LeBron James

- **Correctness:** Uses the window functions correctly to track scoring streaks.
- **Improvement:** Excellent use of case-based grouping and subsequent counting. Double-check `window_group` logic for back-to-back streak cases.

### Final Observations:

Your submission meets most of the requirements. The queries are generally well-structured and efficient. Ensure output comments reflect the dataset in use to provide context to results.

### Submission Notes:

Some assumptions are made based on display comments conflicting with the queries' potential outputs. Dataset details were assumed from the exercise descriptions.

### FINAL GRADE:

```json
{
  "letter_grade": "A",
  "passes": true
}
```

Well done! Your queries demonstrate a good grasp of advanced SQL concepts and practical application. Small tweaks to comments and validation for dataset alignment will further strengthen your submission.
