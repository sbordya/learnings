** This feedback is auto-generated from an LLM **

Thank you for your submission. Let's go through the requirements and evaluate your work:

1. **Disabling Broadcast Joins**: You successfully configured the Spark session to disable the default behavior of broadcast joins using `.config("spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold", "-1")`. This meets the requirement for `query_1`.

2. **Explicit Broadcast Join**: You correctly used `broadcast` on the `medals` table while joining it with `medals_matches_players`, fulfilling `query_2` requirements.

3. **Bucket Join**: You handled bucket joins by writing the data to buckets using `.bucketBy(16, "match_id")` and `sortBy("match_id")`. This is a good approach for `query_3`. However, you also need to ensure that you read the bucketed tables for actual joins, since it seems from the code your final join query did not utilize bucketed tables for joining.

4. **Aggregate Queries**:

   - **Query 4a**: Your function `find_player_with_most_avg_kills_per_game` is implemented correctly, calculating average kills per player by match.
   - **Query 4b**: `find_most_played_playlist` effectively counts the number of occurrences of each playlist.
   - **Query 4c**: Similarly, `find_most_played_map` counts map occurrences, fulfilling `query 4c`.
   - **Query 4d**: `find_map_with_most_killing_spree_medals` correctly aggregates Killing Spree medals by map, meeting this criterion.

5. **Optimizing Data Size**:
   - You correctly implemented partitioning and used `.sortWithinPartitions` on several low-cardinality fields, as required in `query_5`. The results are output in a manner that shows an analysis of the file sizes and number of files, meeting the criteria for optimization.

### Suggestions:

- In a large distributed environment, ensure the explicit use of the bucketed tables for joins; it was somewhat ambiguous if your joins fully utilized the newly written bucketed tables.
- Provide comments or documentation within the code to help clarify the steps taken and assumptions made.

Overall, the coding style is neat and adheres to PySpark best practices. Your submission meets the requirements comprehensively with minor improvements regarding bucket join usage.

**FINAL GRADE**:

```json
{
  "letter_grade": "A",
  "passes": true
}
```

Keep up the great work!
