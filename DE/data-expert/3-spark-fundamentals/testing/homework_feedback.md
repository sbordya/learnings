** This feedback is auto-generated from an LLM **

Thank you for your submission. I have reviewed the files you've provided for the SparkSQL conversion, PySpark jobs, and accompanying tests. Here are my comments and feedback:

### Backfill Query Conversion

- The conversion of the `actors_history_scd` query to SparkSQL appears to be correct. You've used common window functions such as `lag()` to identify changes in `is_active` and `quality_class`, which is appropriate for the Slowly Changing Dimensions logic.
- The CTE logic is effectively used to prepare the data in stages (`actors_with_prev_dim`, `actors_with_change_status`, `actors_with_change_order`, and `increment`), culminating in the final output.

### PySpark Job (`actors_history_scd_backfill_job.py`)

- The PySpark job correctly encapsulates the Spark SQL logic in the `do_actors_history_scd_backfill` function. You have adhered to best practices by utilizing temporary views for intermediate operations.
- The `main()` function successfully writes the transformed data back to a table. Ensure that the table "actors_history_scd" can accept this transformation, which you might want to reflect in database table creation scripts.

### Tests (`test_actors_history_scd_backfill.py`)

- The test case for the backfill job appears comprehensive. You've provided both input data and expected output data, which is crucial for validating the business logic.
- The use of `chispa`'s `assert_df_equality` is appropriate to ensure your actual output matches the expected output.
- Consider adding more test cases involving multiple actors or edge cases to further validate your logic.

### Second Query and Job Conversion

- The second SparkSQL conversion in `datelist_int_job.py` and its corresponding test in `test_datelist_int.py` are correctly implemented. You followed the logical steps to explode the `device_activity_datelist`, compute the integer representation with `pow()`, and aggregate results by `user_id`, `browser_type`, and `curr_date`.
- This demonstrates a proper understanding of lateral view and complex aggregations in SparkSQL.

### Additional Comments

- Excellent use of namedtuples for defining your schema in the test cases, which increases readability.
- Code formatting and overall project structure, including directory organization, are well-executed.

Overall, your submission shows a clear understanding of SparkSQL, PySpark, and data testing principles.

### Suggested Improvements

1. **Edge Cases:** Consider adding more tests covering edge cases for both jobs to ensure robustness.
2. **Code Comments:** Add more comments within the code to explain the purpose of each query section, which aids maintainability.

### Final Grade

Based on the submission's thoroughness, accuracy, and alignment with best practices, here is the final grade:

```json
{
  "letter_grade": "A",
  "passes": true
}
```

Keep up the excellent work! If you have any questions or need further clarification, don't hesitate to reach out.
