**Feedback for LingQ's KPI and Experimentation Submission**

Thank you for submitting your homework on proposing experiments for LingQ, a language-learning application! Here is my detailed review of your submission:

### User Journey:

- You provided a clear and engaging narrative about your experiences with LingQ. Your description highlights the flexibility and value that LingQ provides, especially your ability to import external content from Netflix, YouTube, and news articles. This personalized approach adds significant value to the user experience, making it memorable.

### Experiment Design:

**Experiment 1: LingQ + Netflix Subscription Bundle**

- **Objective:** The rationale for testing a bundled subscription with Netflix is innovative and could potentially attract a broader audience.
- **Hypotheses:** Both the null and alternative hypotheses are clearly stated and relevant to the experiment’s objective.
- **Metrics:** Your choice of leading (average time spent) and lagging metrics (conversion and retention rates) is appropriate, as they should effectively measure both engagement and the financial impact of the bundle.
- **Test Cell Allocation:** The distribution of users across the three groups is well-balanced, allowing for a comprehensive comparison.

**Experiment 2: AI-Powered Custom Dialogues for Newcomers**

- **Objective:** Introducing AI-generated dialogues caters to real-world applications, potentially enhancing user engagement by facilitating practical language practice.
- **Hypotheses:** You’ve set clear hypotheses that align with your objectives.
- **Metrics:** The chosen metrics effectively capture immediate engagement (session length) and longer-term outcomes (conversion and renewal rates), making them suitable for assessing the experiment’s impact.
- **Test Cell Allocation:** The 50/50 split is logical, ensuring each group's results can be compared for a significant number of users.

**Experiment 3: Peer Practice with Shared Lessons**

- **Objective:** This experiment targets social learning dynamics, which could boost motivation and learning through peer interaction.
- **Hypotheses:** Your hypotheses are well-defined and relevant to the experiment.
- **Metrics:** The leading metric of time spent per week and lagging metrics focused on retention and learning progression are suitable for evaluating the enhancement in user engagement and educational outcomes.
- **Test Cell Allocation:** Again, the 50/50 allocation is appropriate to measure the potential impact of peer interaction.

### Overall Feedback:

- Your submission demonstrates a solid understanding of experiment design, with a clear focus on enhancing user experience through innovative concepts.
- The metrics you have selected align well with your hypotheses and are likely to provide meaningful insights into the experiment outcomes.

Your work is thoughtful and well-structured, with experiments designed to bring practical improvements to the user experience on LingQ.

### Suggestions for Improvement:

- Consider adding some qualitative metrics, like user satisfaction surveys, to complement quantitative metrics for a more comprehensive evaluation.
- Ensure that any new features implemented align with existing product capabilities and infrastructure for smooth integration.
