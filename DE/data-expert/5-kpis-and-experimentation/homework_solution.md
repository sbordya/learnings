# LINGQ'S KPI AND EXPERIMENTATION

I am going to discuss LingQ, a language-learning application. I have used LingQ because it makes language study enjoyable through stories, instant dictionaries, listening, and importing my own reading material. I could simply read, listen, and complete exercises while passively absorbing the language. I especially loved that I could import news articles, YouTube videos, and even Netflix content directly into LingQ, allowing me to study word-by-word in context.

## Experiment 1: LingQ + Netflix Subscription Bundle

**Objective:** Since LingQ already allows importing Netflix videos, bundling a LingQ subscription with a Netflix subscription could be attractive to language learners. Personally, I am more likely to pay for such a combo than for Netflix alone. The goal is to test if this bundle increases subscription uptake and engagement compared to LingQ-only plans.

**Null Hypothesis:** LingQ + Netflix bundle will not significantly outperform LingQ-only subscriptions in engagement or sales.

**Alternative Hypothesis:** LingQ + Netflix bundle will significantly increase engagement and sales.

**Leading Metric:** Average time spent in LingQ per user after subscription.

**Lagging Metrics:** Conversion rate to paid subscription, retention rate after the first billing cycle.

**Test Cell Allocation:**

- 33% Free LingQ (control)
- 33% Paid LingQ only
- 34% Paid LingQ + Netflix bundle

## Experiment 2: AI-Powered Custom Dialogues for Newcomers

**Objective:** Newcomers often join LingQ because they moved to a country and want to survive basic conversations. Adding an AI-powered tool that creates a custom dialogue for their situation, then turns it into a repeatable lesson, could increase engagement. They would be able to practice and repeat vocabulary until comfortable for real-life interaction.

**Null Hypothesis:** AI-customized dialogues will not significantly increase engagement compared to standard lessons.

**Alternative Hypothesis:** AI-customized dialogues will increase engagement and retention.

**Leading Metric:** Average session length in the first 14 days after onboarding.

**Lagging Metrics:** Conversion rate to paid plans, renewal rate after 3 months.

**Test Cell Allocation:**

- 50% Standard onboarding flow
- 50% Onboarding with AI-customized dialogues

## Experiment 3: Peer Practice with Shared Lessons

**Objective:** Pairing users who are learning the same material so they can practice together (voice/video calls or text chat) could boost motivation. Offering this for free or within the paid tier could increase time spent on the platform and learning progress.

**Null Hypothesis:** Peer-practice matching will not significantly impact engagement or learning outcomes.

**Alternative Hypothesis:** Peer-practice matching will significantly improve engagement and learning outcomes.

**Leading Metric:** Time spent per week in LingQ.

**Lagging Metrics:** Retention after 3 months, progress KPIs such as number of words learned, lesson difficulty progression, and conversion of learners into peer tutors.

**Test Cell Allocation:**

- 50% Standard lesson experience
- 50% Lesson experience + peer practice feature
