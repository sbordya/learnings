Dear Student,

Thank you for your submission for the Week 5 assignment on Data Pipeline Maintenance. Hereâ€™s some feedback based on your work:

### Ownership & Responsibilities

1. **Clarity and Structure:**
   - You have clearly outlined the primary and secondary owners for each pipeline, which enhances accountability.
   - Assignments seem logical, leveraging the expertise of specific teams; however, it's a little unusual to list two separate teams as a primary owner without further clarification (e.g., Finance Team / Risk Team for the Profit pipeline). Consider designating one clear primary owner for better clarity unless they function as a single unit.

### Fair On-Call Schedule

1. **Fairness and Feasibility:**
   - Your schedule is fair with a weekly rotation and provides clarity on the hand-off process. This includes the Monday morning briefing, which is a practical approach.
   - The consideration for holiday coverage through advance shift swaps is a thoughtful touch and contributes to an equitable workload distribution.

### Runbooks

1. **Clarity and Detail:**

   - Each runbook contains essential information, including data sources, common issues, SLAs, and on-call procedures. This shows a thorough understanding of each pipeline's requirements.
   - The issues listed are realistic and relevant to their respective pipelines.

2. **Comprehensive Coverage:**
   - All runbooks are comprehensive and cover necessary details adequately. However, it might be beneficial to expand on the "On-Call" procedures to include potential initial steps an on-call engineer might take when an issue arises, even though solutions are not required.
   - For the "Profit Pipeline," it might be helpful to specify more details on the communication process when discrepancies require verification by an accountant.

### Markdown Formatting

- The submission is well-structured, easy to read, and organized efficiently in Markdown format.

### Suggestions for Improvement

- Consider adding more details describing the relationship between dual owners in scenarios (like the Profit pipeline) or choosing one to avoid confusion.
- Include initial troubleshooting steps in the runbooks to provide a bit more guidance even though solutions aren't required.
- Enhance the documentation of any distinct responsibilities or processes for co-owners, if applicable.

Overall, you have provided a strong and thoughtful submission that meets the key elements outlined in the assignment.

### Final Grade:
